"Road Accident Insights: A Comprehensive Dashboard for 2021-2022"

In this project, I was responsible for creating a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022. The purpose of this dashboard 
was to provide valuable insights to the clients regarding various aspects of road accidents. I performed data cleaning using different methods to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. Additionally, I conducted data processing, analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful information.

By utilizing pivot tables, I identified the primary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as well as the secondary KPIs. 
The primary KPI focused on the total casualties that occurred after accidents, providing a comprehensive understanding of the severity 
of the incidents. 
Furthermore, I analyzed the total casualties in relation to accident severity and determined the percentage of casualties based on 
different vehicle types. This allowed for a clear assessment of the impact of accidents and vehicle-related factors on casualties.

Moreover, I developed a monthly trend analysis that compared the number of casualties between the current and previous years. This 
analysis provided an overview of the progress made in reducing casualties and highlighted any areas of concern. I also identified the 
road types with the highest number of casualties, enabling the clients to prioritize safety measures and allocate resources accordingly.

Additionally, I examined the distribution of total casualties based on different road surface conditions, providing insights into the correlation between road surface and accidents. Lastly, I explored the relationship between casualties and various factors such as area/location and day/night time, aiding in targeted safety interventions and resource allocation.

Overall, the road accident dashboard I created successfully fulfilled the client's requirements, offering concise and impactful 
summaries of the primary and secondary KPIs. The project allowed the clients to gain valuable insights into the casualties resulting 
from road accidents, evaluate accident severity, identify high-risk vehicle types, analyze monthly trends, determine the impact of road types and surfaces, and understand the relationship between casualties and area/location as well as day/night time.
